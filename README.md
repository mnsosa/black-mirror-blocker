# Black Mirror Blocker
 The black mirror blocker using differents machine learning segmentation models.

The main idea is to block a person in a video, like in the Black Mirror episode called "White Christmas".

It must have 3 key things:
1. To block in an image a person
2. To block in a video a person
3. To mute in a video a person


Right now, the project can do the first and the second thing using the Mediapipe model.
